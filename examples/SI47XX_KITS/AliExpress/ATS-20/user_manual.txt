USER MANUAL

Features

* Modes: FM, AM and SSB
* Two FM bands covering from 64 to 108 MHz
* LW band
* Two MW bands (one for Europe, Africa and Asia)
* Twenty three bands. Two VHF(FM); one LW; two MW; and Nineteen SW bands covering from 1800 to 30000 kHz
* FM/RDS
* Bandwidth control on FM mode (Auto, 110, 84, 60 and 40 kHz)
* Bandwidth control on AM mode (1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 6 kHz)
* Bandwidth control on SSB mode (0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4 kHz)
* Receiver status stored into the EEPROM
* The final code (HEX file) is about 2.5K smaller than the previous one (now  you have more memory to add new features)
* All the previous status of the receiver can be rescued when you turn it on (including SSB mode, bandwidth, volume, frequency, BFO etc)
* The bandwidth is a property of the band (you can use different bandwidth for different bands)
* The seek function was improved (it is more precise on FM mode). The seek direction is controlled by the encoder (clockwise or counter-clockwise . Press encoder push button for seeking
* Steps: 1, 5, 9, 10 and 50 kHz
* Now you can configure MW band space to 9 or 10 kHz
* Added a MW band for Europe, Africa and Asia
* The frequency on Display is bigger than the previous version
* Now the bandwidth sequence is ordered by bandwidth values
* After about 4 seconds, all command buttons are all disabled and the encoder control goes back to the frequency

NEW:
* Some device come with an encoder that breaks easily. If that happens, the device can now be fully operated by using buttons only.
* Buttons can now react on the follwing events:
  - Shortclick (or just CLICK) occurs if a button has been shortpressed.
  - A Doubleclick (or 2CLICK) is two shortclicks in very quick succession.
  - a Longpress (or LP) is a long press and hold of a button.
  - a Double-Longpress (or 2LP) is a short click followed by a longpress in very quick succession.
  - LP/2LP-events have a continuous functionality attached normally (like constantly increase the volume as long as "Vol+" is pressed.
    There are functions that react only once during a longpress episode (like LP on encoder to Mute/Unmute the radio).
    To denote this, such events will be labelled as LP(once) or 2LP(once)
* The behaviour described below is the default behaviour, that might be changed to your liking (see README TBD)


COMMANDS

- assigned to "BAND+":
  - CLICK: toggle command to change the Band by rotating the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle between first and last band defined
  - LP: Switch to next band as long as button is pressed, stop at the last defined band.
  - 2LP(once): Switch (just once) to next band (again no wrap around)

- assigned to "BAND-":
  - CLICK: toggle command to change SoftMute by rotating the encoder (ignored in FM-Mode)
  - 2CLICK: toggle between min and max value of SoftMute (ignored in FM-Mode)
  - LP: Switch to previous band as long as button is pressed, stop at the first band defined.
  - 2LP(once): Switch (just once) to previous band (again no wrap around)

- assigned to "VOL+":
  - CLICK/2CLICK: toggle command to change the Volume by rotating the encoder
  - LP/2LP: continuously increase Volume up to max (63)

- assigned to "VOL-"
  - CLICK: toggle command to change AVC by rotating the encoder (ignored in FM-Mode)
  - 2CLICK: toggle AVC value between min (12), average (38) and max (90) (not in FM-mode)
  - LP: continuously decrease Volume up to min (0)
  - 2LP: continuously increase/decrease AVC between 12/90 (direction changes with every 2LP) (not in FM-mode)  

- assigned to "STEP" (not in FM-Mode):
  - CLICK: toggle command to change Step by rotating the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle Step-Value between Min/Max-step defined (for specific AM/SSB band)
  - LP/2LP: continuously increase/decrease Step between min/max (direction changes with every press)

- assigned to "BW":
  - CLICK: toggle command to change Bandwidth by rotating the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle Bandwidth between min/max defined for the current band
  - LP: continuously increase/decrease Bandwidth between min/max (direction changes with every press)
  - 2LP(once): set the default Bandwidth defined for the current band.

- assigned to "AGC" (not in FM-Mode): 
  - CLICK: toggle command to change AGC/Attenuation by rotating the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle Attenuation between min (0) and max (36)
  - LP: continuously increase/decrease AGC/Attenuation between AGC/0..36 (direction changes with every press)
  - 2LP(once): set AGC

- assigned to "MODE":
  - CLICK/2CLICK: in FM-Mode: toggle RDS off/on, else toggle between AM/LSB/USB-mode
  - LP(once)/2LP(once): toggle "Encoder-Simulation-Mode" (see below)

- assigned to "Rotary-Encoder-Button" (at normal play):
  - 2CLICK/2LP will be ignored
  - CLICK: if any command is selected (to be changed by rotary encoder), cancel that command immediately (not waiting for timeout)
           else if in AM/FM-Mode: start search
           else if in SSB-Mode: toggle rotary encoder between BFO/VFO-setting
  - LP(once): toggle Mute (if muted, "XX" will be displayed as current volume)

- assigned to "Rotary-Encoder-Button" (at startup):
  - if pressed when powered on, EEPROM will be cleared
  - CLICK: if intro is still running will cancel the intro screen direction
  - LP: if intro is still running will also clear the EEPROM 
  - 2CLICK/2LP will be ignored

Encoder-Simulation-Mode (ESM)

* Some devices come with a rotary encoder that is broken easily. This mode is intended to simulate the encoder by buttons only.
* If "Encoder-Simulation-Mode" is active, the display of the frequency unit (kHz/MHz) at the upper right will be inverted.
* In Active encoder mode (full button event change description is below):
  - CLICK/LP on "BAND+" will be the same as rotating the encoder right 
  - CLICK/LP on "BAND-" will be the same as rotating the encoder left
  - CLICK/LP on "AGC" will be the same as CLICK/LP on the encoder Button
* Note that the encoder itself will stay fully operational in this mode

- behaviour of button "BAND+" in ESM:
  - CLICK: identical to one turn right of the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle command to change the Band by rotating the encoder (like CLICK in "normal" mode)
  - LP: identical to continously turning the encoder right
  - 2LP(once): Switch (just once) to next band (as in "normal mode")

- behaviour of button "BAND-" in ESM:
  - CLICK: identical to one turn left of the encoder
  - 2CLICK: toggle command to change SoftMute by rotating the encoder (like CLICK in "normal" mode)
  - LP: identical to continously turning the encoder left
  - 2LP(once): Switch (just once) to previous band (as in "normal mode")

- behaviour of button "AGC" in ESM:
  - CLICK: identical to CLICK on the encoder button
  - 2CLICK: toggle command to change AGC/Att by rotating the encoder (like "normal" CLICK, not in FM-Mode)
  - LP: identical to LP on the encoder button
  - 2LP: Change AGC/Att as long as pressed (like "normal" LP, not in FM-Mode)
